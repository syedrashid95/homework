3 Observations:
Thanks to the scatter plot, we are able to see that urban cities tend to have more rides and their fares are lower compared to rural and suburban areas.
We can see that the amount of fare cost is more expensive in areas with less drivers, this could be due to less compeition drivers can upcharge their wages.
The data shows that urban city drivers have more competition due to the higher amount of drivers, which could be a reason why the fares are less in urban cities compared to the other two.
